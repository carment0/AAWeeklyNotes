# hash map
## set
- require 'set', Set.new
- not ordered and unique, ADT
    - time complexity-- include?, insert, delete -- all these are O(n)
    - for a better algorithm, convert to an array to search?
        - why? array is a continuously stored data, store as binary coding in the RAM. The array object knows it's RAM address and it's length.
        - how? Pointer arithmetic : If you know the initial RAM address (they are stored next to each other) and the index to look for, you take the RAM address + 8 * the index = the RAM address of what you are looking for (# + 8n)
        - time complexity-- pro: include?, insert, delete -- O(1)
        - space complexity-- con: only for integer, takes up space with large integers and the space complexity is based on the range ()
    - how about fixing the range for a better algorithm?
        - use % to get the reminder and get a new range
        - integer % size of array = to a range of 0 to size of array - 1
        - time complexity--con: include?, insert, delete -- O(n/k)(aka O(n)) k remains the same as n grows)
    - increase k to over take n by resizing (increase by a single value)
        - create same or more amount of "buckets" as the elements
        - time complexity--pro/con: include? O(1), insertO(n), delete O(1)
    - increase k in proportional to n (increase by multiple)
        - time complexity--pro/con: include? O(1), insertO(1), delete O(1)
        - space complexity O(1)
        - amortize cost is constant
        - the O(1) are avg meaning this is true if the data set is random and has a even distribution between buckets. however if the data set is ordered and sequenced it can be possible to get the worst case O(n)
            - pathological input: everything goes into the data set
# hashing
- an input goes into the hash function and it changes to a random output
- hash function is
    1. deterministic : when hashing the same input the random output is should always be the same
    2. uniform : any string produced as an output is possible, uniformly distributed
    3. one-way : given the output there is nothing to predict about the input
- two types of hashing function
    - hash funs (to run programming efficiently) : cityhash, CRC32, Murmurhash(used internally in ruby),
    - subhash fns
        - crytographic (slower but less collision, great for security) : MDS, SHA2, Blowfish
    - time complexity--pro/con: include? O(1) WC O(n), insertO(1) WC O(n), delete O(1) WC O(n)
- everything in ruby has dot hash (object.id.hash -> Murmurhash)
    - cons : object id can be different for the same value, stored at a different location
#linked list
- 

## hash set
- by moding the element's hash in the set, you can use any data structure to place into the buckets by using their hash value. the actual value is being stored in the buckets





#How hashes work
- A Hash is a data structure that organizes data in key-value pairs (dictionary or associative array)
- It stores these key-value pairs of associated data in a way that enables efficient insertion and lookup, in constant O(1) time.
##How Rubyâ€™s hash function works
- the purpose of a hash function is to convert a given a key into an integer of limited range
- In order to reduce the range, a commonly used technique is the division method. In the division method, the key is divided by the size of the storage or table and the remainder is the location inside that table where a record can be stored.

# LRU cache
- keeping a small amount of the data in a more accessible location known as a cache rather than a large data memory.
  - The first time a particular piece of data is accessed, the slow method must be used. However, the data is then stored in the cache so that the next time you need it you can access it much more quickly.
  - A cache is much too small to hold all the data you might possibly need, so it will have to remove something from the cache in order to make room for new data.
    - It retain items that are more likely to be retrieved again soon by using a sensible algorithm aka Least Recently Used or LRU.
      - throws out the data that was least(and oldest) recently used.
# Dynamic array ?????
- a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed.
.........


# XOR (Exclusive OR)
- a logical operator, XOR means 'Either A or B, but not both'
- XOR is written as `^`
## bit-wise XOR with numbers
- When you XOR two numbers, Ruby converts them to binary and evaluates each their corresponding digits (i.e. bits) using XOR where 1 is true and 0 is false. Ruby then converts the binary result back into an integer.
  - Integer#to_s(2) converts a number to binary and String#to_i(2) converts a binary string to a number
``` ruby
# For example,

a = 2
b = 6
c = a ^ b # 4
# Let's examine what ruby is doing under-the-hood.

# Converts the operators to binary
a.to_s(2) # "10"
b.to_s(2) # "110"

# Bit-wise operation
# a = 010
# b = 110
# xor ---
# c = 100

# Converts the result back to an integer
"100".to_i(2) # 4

# Thus,
c == 4 # true
```
## Bit-wise XOR to hash ?????/
- the properties of a hashing function:
  - Determinism: Its output is directly determined by the input data.
  - Comprehensiveness: It uses all the input data.
  - Uniformity: Its possible return values are evenly distributed.
  - Continuity: It does not return similar values for similar inputs.
- Bit-wise XOR is often used in hashing functions because it promotes high determinism, comprehensiveness, and uniformity. It also has high continuity, which may need to be offset with other methods where a hashing function needs to have a more unpredictable 'spread' of hashed values.
- What separates XOR from other bit-wise operators is uniformity
  - Only XOR returns 1 and 0 in equal probability, given any two input. This allows it to produce more uniformly distributed values, distinguishing it as a desirable hashing method.
