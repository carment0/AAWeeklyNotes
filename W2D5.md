#How hashes work
- A Hash is a data structure that organizes data in key-value pairs (dictionary or associative array)
- It stores these key-value pairs of associated data in a way that enables efficient insertion and lookup, in constant O(1) time.
##How Rubyâ€™s hash function works
- the purpose of a hash function is to convert a given a key into an integer of limited range
- In order to reduce the range, a commonly used technique is the division method. In the division method, the key is divided by the size of the storage or table and the remainder is the location inside that table where a record can be stored.

# LRU cache
- keeping a small amount of the data in a more accessible location known as a cache rather than a large data memory.
  - The first time a particular piece of data is accessed, the slow method must be used. However, the data is then stored in the cache so that the next time you need it you can access it much more quickly.
  - A cache is much too small to hold all the data you might possibly need, so it will have to remove something from the cache in order to make room for new data.
    - It retain items that are more likely to be retrieved again soon by using a sensible algorithm aka Least Recently Used or LRU.
      - throws out the data that was least(and oldest) recently used.
# Dynamic array ?????
- a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed.

# XOR (Exclusive OR)
- a logical operator, XOR means 'Either A or B, but not both'
- XOR is written as `^`
## bit-wise XOR with numbers
- When you XOR two numbers, Ruby converts them to binary and evaluates each their corresponding digits (i.e. bits) using XOR where 1 is true and 0 is false. Ruby then converts the binary result back into an integer.
  - Integer#to_s(2) converts a number to binary and String#to_i(2) converts a binary string to a number
``` ruby
# For example,

a = 2
b = 6
c = a ^ b # 4
# Let's examine what ruby is doing under-the-hood.

# Converts the operators to binary
a.to_s(2) # "10"
b.to_s(2) # "110"

# Bit-wise operation
# a = 010
# b = 110
# xor ---
# c = 100

# Converts the result back to an integer
"100".to_i(2) # 4

# Thus,
c == 4 # true
```
## Bit-wise XOR to hash ?????/
- the properties of a hashing function:
  - Determinism: Its output is directly determined by the input data.
  - Comprehensiveness: It uses all the input data.
  - Uniformity: Its possible return values are evenly distributed.
  - Continuity: It does not return similar values for similar inputs.
- Bit-wise XOR is often used in hashing functions because it promotes high determinism, comprehensiveness, and uniformity. It also has high continuity, which may need to be offset with other methods where a hashing function needs to have a more unpredictable 'spread' of hashed values.
- What separates XOR from other bit-wise operators is uniformity
  - Only XOR returns 1 and 0 in equal probability, given any two input. This allows it to produce more uniformly distributed values, distinguishing it as a desirable hashing method.
