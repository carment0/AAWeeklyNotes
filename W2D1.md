# Inheritance
## Goal
  1. how to extend class
  2. how to override a method
  3. how to call original method

## Extending Classes
- Creating a subclass of a existing class.
- Methods in SuperClass(parent) are available to the SubClass(child).
- `<` aka inherits
  e.g. `class SubClass < SuperClass`
- A SubClass method can override the SuperClass method if modified.
- To implement the original method, the SubClass can call `super` method to use the original method in the SuperClass.

  ``` ruby
  class Animal
    attr_reader :species

    def initialize(species)
      @species = species
    end
  end

  class Human < Animal
    attr_reader :name

    def initialize(name)
      # super calls the original definition of the method
      # If we hadn't passed "Homo Sapiens" to super, then `name` would have
      # been passed by default.
      super("Homo Sapiens")
      @name = name
    end
  end
  ```

# Exceptions
## Goal
  1. when to use exception
  2. how to raise an exception
  3. how to run some code regardless of an exception

## Rescuing Exceptions
- When error is `raise` with an exception, the method stop executing and the exception is thrown.
- The **method's caller** handles the exception.
  - if the callers don't catch the exception, it will bubble up the **call stack**
- Rescuing is implicitly wrapped in a `begin/end` block unless, if the error handling applies to the **whole method**. You can just add `rescue`
``` ruby
# rescue in a method with block
# if the user give a negative number here
def sqrt(num)
  unless num >= 0
    raise ArgumentError.new "Cannot take sqrt of negative number"
  end
  # code to calculate square root...
end

# if sqrt(num) raises an error, it will be recused
def main
  # run the main program in a loop
  while true
    # get an integer from the user
    puts "Please input a number"
    num = gets.to_i

    # the exception will be caught since sqrt(num) is wrapped in the begin/rescue/end block
    begin
      sqrt(num)
    rescue ArgumentError => e # saved exception
      puts "Couldn't take the square root of #{num}"
      puts "Error was: #{e.message}"
    end
  end
end

# rescue in a method without block
def echo_name
  fname, lname = prompt_name

  puts "Hello #{fname} of #{lname}"
rescue
  puts "Please only use two names."
  retry
end
```
### Ensure
  - Whether an exception is raised or not, `ensure` will executed
  ``` ruby
  begin
    a_dangerous_operation
  rescue StandardError => e
    puts "Something went wrong: #{e.message}"
  ensure
    puts "No matter what, make sure to execute this!"
  end
  ```

### Retry
  - `retry` will repeat the block from the `begin` until the operation completes successfully
  ``` ruby
  begin
    a_dangerous_operation
  rescue StandardError => e
    puts "Something went wrong: #{e.message}"
    puts "try again"
    retry
  end
  ```

## Exception Hierarchy
- [List of predefined exception](http://blog.nicksieger.com/articles/2006/09/06/rubys-exception-hierarchy)
- Use an exception after raise and add an error message
  ``` ruby
  raise RuntimeError.new("Didn't try hard enough")
  ```
- You can extend StandardError to create your own
# create a child class error
class CollisionOccurredError < StandardError
end
```ruby
def drive_car
# engine may stall, collision may occur
end

begin
    drive_car
rescue CollisionOccurredError => e
    puts "Rescued from collision!"
ensure
    puts "Car stopped."
end
  ```

# Decomposition into Objects
- OOP
  - decompose complex problems into classes, each of which is responsible for its own state and behavior.
  - more modular thus extensible
  - nouns as classes and verbs as methods
  - state(initialize) vs behavior(actions that modified states with methods)
## Right level of granularity
- Each class should do one thing
- [Curly's Law](https://blog.codinghorror.com/curlys-law-do-one-thing/)
_______________
# Inheritance, Polymorphism and DRY
- avoid duplicating code
- If two Class has the same method use inheritance aka create a parent class.
_______________
# Information hiding/encapsulation
## Private methods
- Only accessed by methods within the class itself
- Allows safety and simple interfaces
- Use `private` for methods that shouldn't be called on the user (only used within the class as a helper function, helps abstracting away the details inside the method implementations) or if they are instance variables (use public getter/setter instead).
## shy code
- A good guiding principle of OO design is: minimize the interfaces between your classes; expose the least possible amount of state and behavior, and have a good reason for every piece of information that you expose.
- the less the user is exposed to, the easier it is to change
_______________
# Unified Modeling Language
- A visual way of describing the relationship between different objects in a system
- UML can describe classes (e.g., the structure of an object-oriented software program) or behavior (e.g., diagramming a set of concurrent processes).
- A class is usually drawn in UML with three components: a name, a set of attributes (instance variables), and a set of methods. The attributes and methods are marked as being public (+), private(-), or protected (#), and class methods are underlined.

# Singleton ????????????
- a module to be used in your class that ensures only one instance of the Class created
  ``` ruby
  require 'singleton'

  class Klass
    include Singleton
   # ...
  end

  Klass.instance
  ```
