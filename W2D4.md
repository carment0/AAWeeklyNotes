# Big-O
## Motivation
- Want to know the scalability between algorithm A vs algorithm B
    - Major factors that effect speed includes number of steps and input
## Model of Computation: RAM
- What constitutes as a step?
- RAM = Random Access Machines
    - mathematical operators and comparison operators step: 1 step
    - loop step: n(how many times we are looping) * #(number of steps in each iteration)
    - Memory access(variables) and function calls: 1 step
    - No constant step
### Asymptotic Analysis
- behavior of a line as it approaches its limit (infinity)
    - constant don't effect the behavior of the line, only shift the line
- [Calculate graph](desmos.com/calculator)
- x: input size, y: steps
- Ignore constant
    - y = 3n + 1 runtime: n  
    - y = 2710 runtime: 1 (when there is only a integer)
- When we asymptoticly analyze an algorithm, you only consider the dominate term (bottle neck- slowest part of your algorithm, only as fast as your bottleneck).
    - dominate term
        - e.g. 3n + 1 => 3n is the dominate term as n gets bigger the 1 becomes insignificant
- the worst case
    - Big O is the asymptotic worst case runtime => O(n)
    - when the value we are looking for isn't in the input
### common classifications
- fastest to slowest
    - O(1) - constant time algorithm
    - O(log n) - logarithmic (inverse of an exponent - input space is being divided)
    - O(n) - linear
    - O(nlog n) - log linear (merge sort, quick sort: best and avg)
    - O(n^2) - quadratic (bubble sort, nested loops x2)
        - O(n^k) - polynomial, k must be >= 2
    - O(2^n) - subset, exponential
    - O(n!) - factorial, permutation
## set definition ????????
- O(g) = {function} => function doesn't dominate g
    - if g = O(n^2) == O(n!)
## space complexity
- how much resource the algorithm is taking up relative to the size of the input, how this take up of resources scales as the input size grows
- how much memory is being taking up
- exclusive or - X OR `^`
