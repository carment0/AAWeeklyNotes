#SQL
## DATABASE
- RM : tables with related data
- RDBMS : provide a means of organizing data and their relationships, persisting that data, and querying that data
  - SQLite3
  - PostgreSQL

- Data Definitions Language - Schema
- Data Manipulation Language - Model

## DB SCHEMAS
- description of the organization of your database into tables and columns
  1. the tables you will have
  2. the columns each of those tables will have
  3. and the data type of each of those columns

### Schema Definitions
Create a import_db.sql file that contains how to create/alter/drop the table to be imported into the a RDBMS
There are three operators that SQL provides to manipulate a database schema:
- CREATE TABLE
- ALTER TABLE
- DROP TABLE

Most common datatypes:
- BOOLEAN
- INT
- FLOAT (stores "floating point" numbers)
- VARCHAR(255) (essentialy a string with a length limit of 255 chars)
- TEXT (a string of unlimited length)

Most common attribute
- PRIMARY KEY
- NOT NULL
- FOREIGN KEY (...) REFERENCES ...(id)

Adding data into the tables
-  INSERT INTO .... VALUES
```SQL
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  birth_date DATE,
  favorite_food_id INTEGER NOT NULL

  FOREIGN KEY (favorite_food_id) REFERENCES favorite_food(id);

  INSERT INTO
    users (name, birth_date, favorite_food_id)
  VALUES
    ("momo", 06012011, SELECT id FROM favorite_food WHERE food = 'fish'),
    ("donut", 12212016, SELECT id FROM favorite_food WHERE food = 'chicken');
);
```

## MODELING RELATIONSHIP
- Foreign keys are how we model relationships between pieces of data across multiple tables

### SQL
Now that we know what these tables look like and generally how relationships are modeled between them, how do we actually get at the data?
- Structured Query Language : a domain-specific language that's designed to query data out of relational databases
- SQL queries are broken down into clauses

1. SELECT takes a list of comma-separated column names; only these columns of data will be retrieved
2. FROM takes a table name to query
3. WHERE takes a list of conditions separated and only rows matching these conditions are returned

#### 4 main data manipulation operations
- SELECT: retrieve values from one or more rows
``` SQL
SELECT
  one or more columns (or all columns with *)
FROM
  one (or more tables, joined with JOIN)
WHERE
  one (or more conditions, joined with AND/OR);
```

- INSERT: insert a row into a table
``` SQL
INSERT INTO
  table name (column names)
VALUES
  (values);
```

- UPDATE: update values in one or more existing rows
``` sql
UPDATE
  table_name
SET
  col_name1 = value1,
  col_name2 = value2
WHERE
  conditions
```

- DELETE: delete one or more rows
```SQL
DELETE FROM
  table_name
WHERE
  conditions
```

#### Querying across multiple tables (JOIN)
A JOIN will do just what you'd expect it to do: join together two tables, resulting in a temporary combined table that you can query just like any other.
- JOIN clauses include an ON statement, in which you specify how exactly those two tables relate to one another. This is where foreign keys come into play.
```SQL
SELECT
  users.name, posts.title
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  likes ON posts.id = likes.post_id
JOIN
  users ON likes.user_id = users.id
```

#### Self join
Rename the tables to made it easy to reference a specific column in a table by creating aliases
``` SQL
SELECT
  team_member.first_name, team_member.last_name,
   manager.first_name, manager.last_name
FROM
  employee AS team_member
JOIN
  employee AS manager ON manager.id = team_member.manager_id
```
#### Subqueries
A subquery can be referenced anywhere a normal table can be referenced. Inside a  FROM clause, you can  JOIN subqueries with other tables, inside a WHERE or HAVING constraint, you can test expressions against the results of the subquery, and even in expressions in the SELECT clause, which allow you to return data directly from the subquery.
- Because subqueries can be nested, each subquery must be fully enclosed in parentheses in order to establish proper hierarchy.

#### NULL and Ternary Logic in SQL
- always use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL in place of the traditional
- NULL value == NULL, we will always get false

#### CASE
- CASE expression is the same as IF/ELSE statement
``` SQL
CASE expression
WHEN value_1 THEN
 result_1
WHEN value_2 THEN
 result_2
[WHEN ...]
ELSE
 result_n
END;
 ```

# PostgreSQL Setup
## Creating the DB
Postgres can support multiple applications, each of which might be storing different kinds of data in their own database. Applications shouldn't have access to each other's databases, even though they are all managed by a single database server (Postgres is the database server)
- initialize the application

Let's create a blank database named bank:
```
~$ psql
psql (9.2.2)
Type "help" for help.

ruggeri=# CREATE DATABASE bank;
CREATE DATABASE
ruggeri=# \q
```
We can connect to our bank DB. We run the psql program, giving it the name of the DB we want to connect to.
```
~$ psql bank
psql (9.2.2)
Type "help" for help.

bank=# \d
No relations found.
```

## Importing the data
- To run schema(where we created and added data to the table) .sql files we need to "pipe them in" to psql bank. This is what the shell's | operation does: cat `learning-sql-example-postgres.sql | psql hello` takes the output of the first command (cat learning-sql-example-postgres.sql, which just outputs the contents of the file) and uses it as the input of the command on the right (psql bank, which runs SQL commands)

# Building a db
## To access or interact by sqlite3
* for SQLite3 `learning-sql-example-postgres.sql | sqlite3 hello.db`, a new .db file will be created
  - to access command-line `sqlite3 hello.db`
    - .tables
    - .schema
    - sql queries, manipulation operations

```
psql bank

<!-- to see the table -->
bank=# \d

<!-- to custom table -->
bank=# SELECT * FROM customer LIMIT 2;
```

## To access or interact by ruby pry instead of sqlite3 on terminal
- with in pry use sqlite3 gem `require 'sqlite3'`
- loading data `hello_db = SQLite3::Database.new('./hello.db')`
- accessing data, similar to sqlite3 `hello_db.execute("SELECT * FROM hello")`
- returns(raw data) a nested array of each row values `[[1, "hellllo"],[2, "hiiii"]]`

# ORM
- helps get the instance of each item returned, showing the attribute of each value.
- to do this you have to define a class with the following methods
  - :: all
  - #initialize
  - #create
  - #update
## mix SQL into our Ruby
heredocs
``` Ruby
db.execute(<<-SQL, post_id)
SELECT
  *
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id
WHERE
  posts.id = ?
SQL
```

``` Ruby
require 'sqlite3'
require 'singleton'

# initialize quivalent to sqlite3 `hello_db = SQLite3::Database.new('./hello.db')`
class PlayDBConnection < SQLite3::Database
  include Singleton

  def initialize
    super('plays.db')
    # same data type
    self.type_translation = true
    # result back as instances with hashed values in array
    self.results_as_hash = true
  end
end

class Play
  attr_accessor :title, :year, :playwright_id

  # all data in the db into instances, hashes
  def self.all
    data = PlayDBConnection.instance.execute("SELECT * FROM plays")
    data.map { |datum| Play.new(datum) }
  end

  def self.find_by_title(title)
    play = PlayDBConnection.instance.execute(<<-SQL, title)
      SELECT
        *
      FROM
        plays
      WHERE
        title = ?
    SQL
    return nil unless play.length > 0

    Play.new(play.first) # play is stored in an array!
  end

  def self.find_by_playwright(name)
    playwright = Playwright.find_by_name(name)
    raise "#{name} not found in DB" unless playwright

    plays = PlayDBConnection.instance.execute(<<-SQL, playwright.id)
      SELECT
        *
      FROM
        plays
      WHERE
        playwright_id = ?
    SQL

    plays.map { |play| Play.new(play) }
  end

  def initialize(options)
    @id = options['id']
    @title = options['title']
    @year = options['year']
    @playwright_id = options['playwright_id']
  end

  # save instance into db
  # creating a new instance of a class does not save it into the db! Use .save. Same with .update
  def create
    raise "#{self} already in database" if @id
    PlayDBConnection.instance.execute(<<-SQL, @title, @year, @playwright_id)
      INSERT INTO
        plays (title, year, playwright_id)
      VALUES
        (?, ?, ?)
    SQL
    @id = PlayDBConnection.instance.last_insert_row_id
  end

  # update instance into db
  def update
    raise "#{self} not in database" unless @id
    PlayDBConnection.instance.execute(<<-SQL, @title, @year, @playwright_id, @id)
      UPDATE
        plays
      SET
        title = ?, year = ?, playwright_id = ?
      WHERE
        id = ?
    SQL
  end
end
```
_____________________________
# Starting rails project
- generating a new rail project, in terminal `rails new Cats -d postgresql` a new folder called Cats is created
- add `gem 'pry-rails'` in Gemfile to use rails console `rails c`
- add `gem annotate`
- `bundle install`

## app
- model: class which represent a table from the db
- controller: handle requests that comes in and access the models and views to build a responds as a json string/object or html view
- view: template filled in with content from the model which is provided by the controller

## config
- database: specify which db we are connect to and what is the name of it
- routes: define what HTTP routes are program makes available and how it decides which controller to create and tigger actions on when a request comes in

## db
- seed: ruby code that we can run to populates the db

## lib
- hold class we have made internally that we are going to use with our rail project

## vendor
- js file and other library from external sources

# Migrations
Create and edit rails db/migrate, a paper trail of how the table got to the state it is in
- in terminal `rails g migrations CreateHouses`
in db/migrate
``` ruby
class CreateHouses < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    create_table :houses do |t|
      # add columns
      t.string :address, null: false
      t.integer :square_feet
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```
- create db `rails db:create`
- `rails db:migrate`, schema file should be create or added in to, only for newly created tables
- to edit table make a new migration
  - `rails g migrations AddColorHouses`
  ``` ruby
  class CreateHouses < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
    def change
      add_column :houses, :color, :string  
      end
    end
  end
  ```
 - `rails db:migrate`

# Models
interacting with the contents of our tables
- make a app/models, using a singular version of the table title
``` ruby
# this allows us to read, write and search House
class House < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```
- now you can call the House class
  - create `house = House.new`
  - assign properties `house.address = "123 1st st"`
  or `house = House.new(address: "123 1st st", color: white)`
  - save instance into db `house.save`

Common methods
- `.destroy`
- `.find(id#)`
- `.find_by(option hash)`
- `.create(address: "123 1st st", color: white)`
  - this create and saves into db

## Association
### for one association
belong_to
``` ruby
class WhateverClassName < ActiveRecord::Base
  belong_to :whatever_name
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :#name of the foreign key in the class you are writing this on
    class_name: :#name of the class you are referring to
end
```

has_many
``` ruby
class WhateverClassName < ActiveRecord::Base #aka ApplicationRecord in Rails 5
  has_many :#name of this function
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :#name of the foreign key in the class referring to this table
    class_name: :#name of the class that is referring to this table 
end
```
- this creates a attr_reader and attr_writer

### for two or more association
has_many and through
``` ruby
class WhateverClassName < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :#name of this function
    through: :#name of association in this class to the other table that has association to the table you want
    source: :#name of the class you want
end

class WhateverClassName < ActiveRecord::Base
  # this give you .first
  has_one :#name of this function(method)
    through: :#name of association in this class to the other table that has association to the table you want
    source: :#name of the class you want
end
```
